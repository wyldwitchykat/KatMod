NOTE:  BEFORE INSTALLING -->ANY<--  MOD, MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR SAVED GAMES!!!



After extracting the downloaded 7z file contents just place the entire folder
"FPS Portable Trader Number 9" into your mods folder and you should be ready to go.

 
There are 2 different Mods folders you can use. This is the folder that contains 
the  0_TFP_Harmony folder and MAY eventually be the preferred location:
 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods


VERY, VERY IMPORTANT:

PLEASE DO NOT DELETE THE  0_TFP_Harmony FOLDER FROM THE ABOVE LOCATION. IT WILL CAUSE
MASSIVE PROBLEMS AND PROBABLY CAUSE C# MODS TO QUIT WORKING!

It is a vanilla folder. If you deleted it, use the “verify integrity of game files” 
option to download it again:

From the Steam Launcher, right-click on the game from the Library and select Properties from the menu.
Select the Installed Files tab and click Verify integrity of game files.
Steam will verify the game’s files. This process may take several minutes.
Once the process is completed, the Check Window will automatically exit.


Another folder is located here and it currently is the preferred location:

C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\Mods

AppData is a hidden folder. You can choose to "unhide" it in the View settings.

You can also put   %AppData%\7DaysToDie\Mods  in the address bar in Windows Explorer
or in the Search Box on your desktop and it will take you to the correct location.


PLEASE USE ONLY ONE OF THESE LOCATIONS TO INSTALL MODS INTO!!!!



The inventory items in the machine will include items from each of the 
normal traders and vending machines at normal buy and sell pricing.
It's inventory will reset after 1 game day. Seeds and vehicles are included!

There is a recipe included in the mod for crafting the FPS Portable Trader Number 9.

If you want to relocate the machine, simply destroy it and it will reappear in 
your inventory. To permanantly get rid of it, just scrap it. If you uninstall the
mod, all of the FPS Portable Trader Number 9 should be scrapped first.

Special thanks to IDC for creating a .dll file to fix some errors that prevented selling
to the machine!  I really appreciate it!


I hope you enjoy the mod!
