***** FPS Buried Supplies Fix *****


NOTE:  BEFORE INSTALLING -->ANY<--  MOD, MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR SAVED GAMES!!!



After extracting the downloaded 7z file contents just place the entire folder
"FPS Buried Supplies Fix" into your mods folder and you should be ready to go.

 
There are 2 different Mods folders you can use. This is the folder that contains 
the  0_TFP_Harmony folder and may eventually be the preferred location:
 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods


VERY, VERY IMPORTANT:

PLEASE DO NOT DELETE THE  0_TFP_Harmony FOLDER FROM THE ABOVE LOCATION. IT WILL CAUSE
MASSIVE PROBLEMS AND PROBABLY CAUSE C# MODS TO QUIT WORKING!

It is a vanilla folder. If you deleted it, use the “verify integrity of game files” 
option to download it again:

From the Steam Launcher, right-click on the game from the Library and select Properties from the menu.
Select the Installed Files tab and click Verify integrity of game files.
Steam will verify the game’s files. This process may take several minutes.
Once the process is completed, the Check Window will automatically exit.


Another folder is located here:
C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\Mods

AppData is a hidden folder. You can choose to "unhide" it in the View settings.

You can also put   %AppData%\7DaysToDie\Mods  in the address bar in Windows Explorer
or in the Search Box on your desktop and it will take you to the correct location.


PLEASE USE ONLY ONE OF THESE LOCATIONS TO INSTALL MODS INTO!!!!


This mod removes the code that is breaking the Buried Treasure Quests that the 
Traders give you and the Intro Buried Treasure Quest that Rekt gives you. This
removes the requirement that makes these quests spawn in roads which often fail
when you start the quest by clicking on the jumping "!" icon.
This makes these quests perform like they did in A21.
It does NOT have anything to do with the Treasure Maps! 
 

I want  to give a special "Thank You" to BrianMcBrian for helping me with this code!
I couldn't have done it without him!



I hope you enjoy the mod!
