T2 into T3 grade weapons -- by LittleRedSonja

Changelog:

1.0.0 - Add 2 new weapons, the "Seal Combat Knife" and the "Titanium Baseball Bat". Keep look, animations and sounds of the T2 weapons but get upgraded stats. Weapon stats are tweaked and tested to make it as balanced as possible, while keeping it fun. The Seal Combat Knife can equip a Flame mod, unlike the hunting knife. Unlocks at same levels and skill as the T3 equivalents, and requires weapon parts to craft.

1.1.0 - Add the Winchester 1873 Rifle, a Tier 3 lever action rifle. It uses .44 ammunition, making it a good companion to your Magnum .44 or Desert Vulture. Tweaked stats to make it balanced and a competitive alternative to the Sniper Rifle. 

1.1.1 - Fixed Winchester Rifle doing less damage than expected. Since it fires .44 instead of 7.62 and the game considers .44 to be an only-pistol ammunition, it was not doing full damage when used in rifles. It will do full damage       now. 
      - Fixed Winchester Rifle doing less head damage than expected. 
      - Slightly tweaked damage and durability for Seal Combat Knife and Titanium Baseball Bat, to make them a more attractive alternative. 

1.2.0 - "Lock, Stock, and two smoking barrels" update. 
      - Add the Holland & Holland Paradox, a very powerful T3 double barrel shotgun that can shoot Hellfire shells in adition to the usual shotgun ammo.
      - Add the Remington 870, a high shock and damage T3 pump shotgun.
      - Removed the black gunpowder effect from the Winchester 1873 rifle. Since it shoots modern ammunition that effect does not make sense.

Do you love the Hunting Knife but late game have to upgrade to Machete "because higher damage"? Dis you upgrade to Steel Club but miss the distinct THUNK sound of your beloved Baseball Bat? Fear no more! I present you the "Seal Combat Knife" and the "Titanium Baseball Bat". Keep look, animations and sounds of the T2 weapons but get upgraded stats. Unlocks at same levels and skill as the T3 equivalents, and requires weapon parts to crat.Â 

The Titanium Baseball Bat

Bonk those zombies in style with this impressive 32 inches baseball bat made of solid unforgiving hardwood with a Titanium core. The use of the Titanium Baseball Bat was declared a war crime by the UN right before the zombie apocalypse. The Titanium Baseball Bat inflicts slightly less damage than the steel club and it is less durable, but it is faster, lighter, and the satisfying THUNK sound makes up for it.Â 

The Seal Combat Knife

This 11 inches knife will never let you down. You can always relay on it's laminated cobalt steel blade to open a tuna can or to Choppity Chop your way out of a zombie infested room. The Seal Combat Knife inflicts slightly less damage than the machete but its fastest attack speed and less stamina use compensate this. You have to take good care of it though, since it is less durable than the machete.

The Winchester 1873 Rifle

"The Gun That Won the West" was one of the most successful rifles of its day. Cowboys love this reliable rifle because it fires the same .44 ammo as their revolver. Fill your hands with this magnificent rifle, saddle up and blaze your trail into the sunset! The Winchester inflicts slightly less damage than the Sniper Rifle and has shorter range, but can fire faster and chambers 15 .44 rounds, making it the ideal companion for your .44 revolver.
