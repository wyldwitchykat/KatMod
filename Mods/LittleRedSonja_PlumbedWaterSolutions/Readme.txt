-- Plumbed In Water Solutions --7 days to die v 1.0 mod - by LittleRedSonja --

Installation Instructions:

Extract the downloaded zip into your 7D2D Mods folder (create one if it does not exist).

To verify you have installed the mod correctly, the ModInfo.xml file should be located at Mods\LittleRedSonja_PlumbedWaterSolutions\ModInfo.xml relative to your 7D2D install folder.


This mod is Server-Only-Friendly (for multiplayer the mod need to be installed only in the server, player do not need to install it).

Added several plumbed in water fixtures. Unlike the dew collector these fixtures provide murky, fresh water or even pure mineral water without waiting, just open the tap and get as much fresh water as you want, in the same way you would do with any modern sink. Craftable in the workbench as a Variant Helper, you need to learn "Plumbing", which unlocks at Workstations level 15 for the basic fixture, and additional features unlocks at levels 25 and 50, making this a mid-game feature. There is an alternative version of this mod (UNLOCKED version) that do not require any levels in crafting skills to unlock the recipe. 

The water fixtures are both decorative and functional, several different models for you to choose, even separate faucets so you can create your own custom sink in your own personal style. They do not generate heat when used. 

You can pick them up again by holding "E" (you will get that same fixture back) or using a salvage tool (you will get the Variant Helper instead). 

Like all my other mods so far, this mod is "Server-side-only friendly" (if you play multiplayer the mod only need to be installed in the server, if you play single player install the mod as usual).

I hope you enjoy the mod, and if you find issues or have suggestions let me know  ðŸ’œ

Frequently asked questions: 

1- Is your mod compatible with X, Y or Z mod? : Yes, as far as I know my mod is compatible with every other single mod for 7DTD, including of course all my other mods, and other popular mods such as "GNS Beautiful bases" or "Sams Working Stuff". If you find a mod that is incompatible with mine please let me know and I will see if a compatibility patch can be made. 

2- Can the mod be used server side only?: Yes, the mod can be used both server side only (so if the server where you play have it installed you do not need to install it yourself) or client side (if you play solo instead of multiplayer then you install the mod as usual). 

3- Why is this not included in "Fancy Home Deco?": Since this mod include a feature (free unlimited easy fresh water) that can change game balance mid-late game there might be players or servers that do not want to include it. That is why I release it as a separate feature, but it is totally compatible and integrated with my other mods.
