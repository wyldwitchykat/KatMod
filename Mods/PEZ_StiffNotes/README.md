# PEZ Stiff Notes

This mod scatters pages of notes around the world. Found rarely in loot, you'll gain a skill point when you read one.

This is intended to be used in place of "X Skill Points Per Level" type mods, just to add a bit more excitement by finding skill points as random drops.

They're found about as often as Treasure Maps and Rare Books, but also have a small chance to show up in T1 and T2 chests, as well as in air drops. This is meant to be balanced for solo play without being too powerful. You might have around 5 extra skill points (give or take) by the Day 14 horde, but late game you will have likely found quite a few.

## Complimentary Mods
