Materials definitions

Attributes:
* id - mandatory, type: string, semantic: defines name of the material to be referenced within block tags
* lightopacity (int) - sunlight values can be 0-15. A block can reduce this by up to 15.
* hardness (float) - mandatory. Vlues go from 1 to infinite, hardnes="1" means one hit with current digger destroys the block
	<property name="Hardness" type="float" value="5"/>
	Block damage is reduced to 1/5 of default damage.
* explosionresistance (1.0f): The higher the better.
* collidable (bool):	this is used as default for a block that uses this material - but only if this block does not override it with its own Collide mask.
		So if a material sets collideable and a block uses this material (without overriding it), everything collides with this block
* movement_factor - optional, float: if specified then this factor is applied to the movement. values < 1 slow down player. value = 1 does nothing, > 1 increases speed
* friction (0.454f) - default surface friction
* plant (bool) - optional, currently used only for farmland, if a "no plant" block is placed on top of a farmland block it turns to dirt
* fertile_level (int) - optional, int: some plants need a certain fertile level to grow
* growable - optional, bool: a farm land block turn to dirt of no water and no "growable" block is nearby
* stability_glue (int): in the horizontal plane, each of the 4 sides of this block will hold this mass
* StabilitySupport (bool): if false, this block does not support anything built ON TOP of it
* Mass (2 int) : the counterpart of stability_glue. A stability_glue of 7 will not support a mass of 9.
* MaxDamage (100 int) : hit points of the block

* damage_category = head, glass, stone, cloth, concrete, boulder, metal, wood, earth, snow, plants, leaves
	Used to determine the damage category if an item hits this block.
	This corresponds to <property name="DamageBonus.earth" value="5"/> in items.xml so this is used for bonus damage.

* surface_category = cloth, earth, glass, metal, organic, plant, stone, water, wood
	Used to determine the sound + effect on impact.
	Assets\Textures\Blocks\blocktextures.xml CAN override this on a per-texture base by referencing a MATERIAL ID and using it's SURFACE_CATEGORY.
	If no VALID material id is referenced in blocktextures.xml, the surface_category of the BLOCK's material is used.

* forge_category : needed to tally up smelt/scrap result
* ground_cover (bool)
* liquid
* particle_category
* particle_destroy_category
* stepsound (str)
* Experience (1.0f) :
	Making blocks fertile provides fertile block's material player exp.
	Repairing a block now gives xp based on materials used multiplied by their count.
	Upgrading a block now gives xp based on materials used multiplied by their count.
	Harvesting a block now gives xp based on item materials gained.
	Planting gives block material exp
	DO NOT use values <1. Actual XP awarded WILL be rounded down to int so it would zero on a harvested count of 1.

Do not rename "basic" materials like cloth, metal, or stone. These auto-generate the particle lookup query.
