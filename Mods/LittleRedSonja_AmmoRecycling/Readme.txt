-- Ammunition Recycling --7 days to die v 1.0 mod - by LittleRedSonja --

Installation Instructions:

Extract the downloaded zip into your 7D2D Mods folder (create one if it does not exist).

To verify you have installed the mod correctly, the ModInfo.xml file should be located at Mods\LittleRedSonja_AmmoRecycling\ModInfo.xml relative to your 7D2D install folder.


This is a very simple mod that allows you to recover 80% of the resources from unwanted ammunition in a very easy straightforward way.

You open the ammo and recover the materials in the WORKBENCH. You will get a package, OPEN it (DO NOT SCRAP) and you will get your materials back.
No schematics or levels in crafting skills needed.

It includes 9mm, 7.62, Magnum .44, all the different ammunitions for shotguns and rockets. Version 1.1.0 adds 5.56 and 45 ACP ammo from Izayo Weapons pack. Version 1.2.0 adds support for v2 of Izayo weapons pack (with new weapons and ammunition types) and LittleRedSonja T2 into T3 weapons (adds th Hellfire shells for the Holland & Holland Paradox shotgun).

It takes some time to get the materials back. Opening and recovering materials from more complex types of ammunition, such as rockets or grenades, takes more time (but they will not explode, I promise).

HOW IT WORKS:

1- Take a look at the included picture for additional visual help (thank you FNS for providing it). Open the WORKBENCH. In the left panel, in "Ammo/Weapons" category you will see recipes for "Recycled Ammo" bundles for each type of ammunition. 

2- Make sure you have the ammunition you want to recycle in your backpack. 

3- Select the recipe for the type of ammunition that you want to recycle and click "craft". You can craft more than one bundle at a time as long as you have enough ammunition in your backpack. 

4- After a few seconds you will get one or more "Recycle Ammo" bundles. 

5- Open the bundle, in the same way you would open other bundles in the game, to get the recycled materials. What materials you get depends on what kind of ammunition you are recycling. DO NOT SCRAP the bundle, just OPEN IT.

6- Profit ðŸ˜‰. 


Like all my other mods so far, this mod is "Server-side-only friendly" (if you play multiplayer the mod only need to be installed in the server, if you play single player install the mod as usual).

If you want me to add modded ammunition let me know what mod you want to make compatible and I will look into it ðŸ˜Š I hope you enjoy the mod ðŸ’œ. Let me know too if you have suggestions or find bugs.  ðŸ¥°

Frequently asked questions: 

1- Is your mod compatible with X, Y or Z mod? : Yes, as far as I know my mod is compatible with every other single mod for 7DTD, including of course all my other mods, even full conversions or overhauls should be compatible as long as they do not remove the vanilla ammunition. If you find a mod that is incompatible with mine please let me know and I will see if a compatibility patch can be made. 

2- Can the mod be used server side only?: Yes, the mod can be used both server side only (so if the server where you play have it installed you do not need to install it yourself) or client side (if you play solo instead of multiplayer then you install the mod as usual).

3- Can you add X, Y or Z ammunitions from X, Y or Z mod?: I will be happy to add other ammunitions included in other mods. Just let me know what ammunitions and what mod and I will add them to Ammunition Recycling.
