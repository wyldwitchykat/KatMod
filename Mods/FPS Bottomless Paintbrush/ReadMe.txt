***** FPS Bottomless Paintbrush *****


NOTE:  BEFORE INSTALLING -->ANY<--  MOD, MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR SAVED GAMES!!!

Installs just like almost every mod. Does not require a new game.

This mod should work server side just fine!

After extracting the downloaded 7z file contents just place the entire folder
"FPS Bottomless Paintbrush" into your mods folder and you should be ready to go.

The old Mods folder was located here:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods 

The newer Mods folder (recommended) is located here:
C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\Mods

You can also put   %AppData%\7DaysToDie\Mods  in the address bar in Windows Explorer
or in the Search Box on your desktop and it will take you to the correct location.

This mod gives a special FPS Paintbrush a unlimited supply of paint. Paint everything
without fear of running out of paint and having to loot / buy / craft  more.  
Unleash your creativity! Just craft a FPS Paintbrush! This is NOT the standard brush.

I hope you enjoy the mod!
