# OCB Density Hoe Mod - 7 Days to Die (V1.0) Addon

Harmony MOD (EAC needs to be off) that adds a Farming Hoe for
terrain leveling. Beside the obvious use case, it has an
alternate action that levels terrain with solid cube blocks
and shapes, so you get a clean transition. It will consider
only the 4 directly adjacent blocks. If you perform the
actions while crouching down, it will also include the
4 additional corner blocks (leveling a 3x3 grid).

Needs to be installed client and server side. And both need
EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) to be turned off! There is no server-side
only version of this mod as it contains custom code.

Mod is compatible with Undead Legacy OOTB, but you must rename the
mod folder to e.g. `zOcbDensityHoe` to load it after Undead Legacy.
